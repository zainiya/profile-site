# Motivation

As per the survey conducted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more than 60% people in United states haven’t received influenza (flu) vaccination. People don’t go for vaccination until they hear many victims for flu. This is true for other contagious diseases as well.

In many areas people are not aware of which contagious diseases people are suffering from in their neighborhood.

H1N1 influenza, first detected in Mexico in April 2009 and the virus was originally referred as “swine flu” because many of the genes in the new strain were found in pigs in USA.

In India, During 2015 due to lack of awareness, 33761 confirmed Swine flu cases and 2035 deaths were reported. Out of 33761 cases, 6495 swine flu cases (i.e. 19.24% of total cases) and 428 deaths were observed within the state of Gujarat. 


# Background

People are not aware of widespread diseases in their area.

- Build the system that spread the awareness about diseases.

- Get the disease data from doctors.

Doctors can’t put their patient’s data on digital medium for the awareness as it hurts privacy.

- Assure doctor that data will be secure.

# Proposal

The proposed system creates alert for widespread disease in the area based on number of cases registered for any disease in that area. The patient records are provided by doctors and it is stored on Ethereum blockchain, so no one can tamper with patient records. Alert for widespread disease is generated by applying Regression model on patient records. A crawler is implemented to fetch disease and its symptoms data from web.

# Implementation

Alert Prediction:
Step 1 - Fetch patient records from ethereum and find all zip codes.
Fetch zip codes from  Patient Records

Step 2 - From zip-code find the location and do clustering

Step 3 - For each cluster filter out last 7 days patient records.

Step 4 – Use the fetched data into regression model and forecast the number of cases for next day for every disease. If forecast exceeds threshold then give alert.

# Results and Analysis

Data got stored on blockchain are immutable, even when it gets updated it actually creates new node and store it in a chain.

Got the RMSE Score of 1.9

# Benefits

- User friendly web interface makes it easy to use the system

- User can get alerts via web interface

- System shows all the alerts on map as well, so you can search for the area you are travelling to and it will show widespread diseases in that area.
